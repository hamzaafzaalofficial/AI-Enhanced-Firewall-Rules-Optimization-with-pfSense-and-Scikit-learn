# AI-Enhanced-Firewall-Rules-Optimization-with-pfSense-and-Scikit-learn

--- 
1. pfSense Firewall
Role: Captures and logs network traffic.
Actions: 
Collects firewall logs (/var/log/filter.log).
Exports logs to a file for analysis (/tmp/firewall_export.log).
--- 
2. Data Preprocessing
Role: Prepares the raw firewall logs for analysis.

Actions:

Loads the exported logs into a Python environment.

Cleans and preprocesses the data (e.g., assigns column names, filters relevant features).

3. Machine Learning Model
Role: Analyzes traffic patterns and generates recommendations.

Components:

Clustering (KMeans):

Groups similar traffic patterns (e.g., by IP ranges or ports).

Detects anomalies and calculates block rates for each cluster.

Classification (Decision Tree):

Predicts whether traffic should be allowed or blocked.

Identifies important features (e.g., ports, protocols) using feature importance.

4. Rule Generation
Role: Generates optimized firewall rules based on the analysis.

Actions:

Suggests BLOCK rules for clusters with high block rates.

Suggests ALLOW rules for clusters with low block rates.

Adjusts rules based on feature importance (e.g., UDP protocol, specific ports).

5. Firewall Rule Implementation
Role: Applies the optimized rules in pfSense.

Actions:

Updates firewall rules in the pfSense dashboard.

Tests the new rules using tools like ping and traceroute.

6. Continuous Monitoring
Role: Ensures the effectiveness of the optimized rules.

Actions:

Monitors traffic logs for anomalies.

Periodically re-evaluates and fine-tunes the rules.

Flow of the System
Traffic Logs are collected from pfSense and exported for analysis.

The logs are preprocessed and loaded into a Python environment.

The machine learning model analyzes the traffic using clustering and classification.

Based on the analysis, optimized firewall rules are generated.

The rules are implemented in pfSense and tested for effectiveness.

The system continuously monitors traffic and fine-tunes the rules as needed.
